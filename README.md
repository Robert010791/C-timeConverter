#Investment calculator app

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
This project prompts user to enter values for investments and calucates the return. The user can enter in initail amount, monthly deposit, annual interest and number of years of investment.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt like I did really well setting up classes to handle each year of the investment. I also felt I did really well pushing code from the main function into seperate functions.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One thing I could do to imporve this porject is by adding exceptions to handle errors and incorrect user input. This could make the porject more readable and easier to work on in the future.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I felt that writing the classes was the most challenging part but they also made the project better. I think the best thing I can do now is to keep consistantly working on more projects.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think what I learned about classes can be used on other porjects and is something I am excited to learm more about.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have commments explaining the different functions and classes and I named all the variables so they were easy to understand. I also modularaizd a lot of the functions so they are easy to read.
